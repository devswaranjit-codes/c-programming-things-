## Tips for Success
## Start Simple: Begin with small patterns and gradually increase complexity as you get more comfortable.

## Use Print Statements: Use printf() to print stars, numbers, and spaces in each iteration of the loops.

## Visualize Before Coding: Draw the pattern on paper or use a text editor to visualize the rows and columns before coding.

## Test Often: After writing each code, test it for a few different row values (e.g., 3, 5, 7) to see if the output matches your expectation.

## Practice Exercises
Diamond Pattern (combining pyramid and inverted pyramid).
Half Diamond with Numbers (numbers increasing across rows).
Floyd's Triangle (a triangular pattern of numbers).
